## THIS IS ~basically~ THE FINAL VERSION ##

    In this version, which is designed to run on FS and push to the alarm system, we have further simplified the structure.

    We corrected the killing of the tail command and changed the timeout so that it works now correctly (ie times out after
    inactivity).

    This version relies on an in-built FS function 'lognm'.

    The other two versions should be ignored.
 
    Further thoughts need to be had about the integration of something like this with the current Alarm system. But for now...
