## SOME NOTES: ##

* The configuration file contains ip addresses and folder paths.
        
        - These file directories need to be changed to reflect the deployment (ie the FSs).
        - The present settings are for debug.

* The congfiguration file has a reference to a .nym.pw which should contain the password to Ny (new) Mitra.

* The watchdog script does not work. By construction of the error logger an experiment code is needed.

* To run locally, a copy of an experiment log file is required.
