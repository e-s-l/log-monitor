## BASH V: ##

* This is the better version of the two. The python one was fun but over-engineered (and badly at that).
* There '''will''' be two versions. 
    * One designed to be run on the server (which hosts the rest of the alarm system). This is currently the only version.
    * One designed to be run on the FS where the log file is generated. (See the older Py version.)
